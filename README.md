This project is overall a clone of MOA (Massive Online Analysis) application, created by Waikato University. All its details are described bellow.
Me and Wilson Sasaki Jr used it as a repository for a academic project using the application as base and adding some new features to it. <del> In a near future we will try a pull request of this new features into the original project </del> (https://github.com/Waikato/moa).
The following features were added to the master branch https://github.com/Waikato/moa by our professor Jean Paul Barddal
New features:
* Add precision/recall measurements to the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator class.
* Add F1 measurement to the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator class.
* <del> Add precision/recall mean/current to infopanel </del>


# MOA (Massive Online Analysis)

MOA is the most popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community ([blog](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/blog/)). It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation. Related to the WEKA project, MOA is also written in Java, while scaling to more demanding problems.

## Using MOA

* [Getting Started](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/getting-started/)
* [Documentation](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/documentation/)
* [About MOA](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/details/)

MOA performs BIG DATA stream mining in real time, and large scale machine learning. MOA can be extended with new mining algorithms, and new stream generators or evaluation measures. The goal is to provide a benchmark suite for the stream mining community.
